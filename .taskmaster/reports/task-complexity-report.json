		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into subtasks covering directory structure creation, dependency management, README documentation, and initial testing setup.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear requirements and a straightforward implementation. The complexity is low as it involves standard project setup procedures without complex logic. Breaking it into 4 subtasks would help organize the work around structure creation, dependency management, documentation, and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Config Manager",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the configuration manager implementation into subtasks for default configuration, environment variable loading, file-based configuration, configuration validation, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple configuration sources, validation logic, and error handling. The complexity is moderate as it requires designing a flexible system that handles different file formats and environment variables with proper validation. Five subtasks would effectively separate the different loading mechanisms and validation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the data models implementation into subtasks for the AppEndpoint class, PingLog class, and serialization/deserialization functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating two main data models with relatively straightforward properties and methods. The complexity is moderate-low as it requires designing clean class interfaces and serialization methods. Three subtasks naturally align with the two classes and the serialization functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement HTTP Client",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the HTTP client implementation into subtasks for basic request functionality, error handling, performance measurement, and retry logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing network requests with proper error handling, timeout management, and retry logic. The complexity is moderate as it involves dealing with network operations and measuring performance metrics. Four subtasks would effectively separate the core functionality, error handling, metrics, and retry mechanisms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scheduler",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the scheduler implementation into subtasks for basic scheduling functionality, endpoint management, jitter implementation, threading management, and testing with mocks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex threading, scheduling, and coordination between components. The complexity is high as it requires managing concurrent operations, implementing randomization for intervals, and ensuring thread safety. Five subtasks would help manage this complexity by separating core scheduling, endpoint management, jitter implementation, threading, and testing concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Logging System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the logging system implementation into subtasks for logger configuration, console logging, file logging, and specialized logging methods for different event types.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a flexible logging system with multiple outputs and log levels. The complexity is moderate as it involves configuring the Python logging module and creating specialized logging methods. Four subtasks would effectively separate configuration, console logging, file logging, and specialized logging methods."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Application Class",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the main application class implementation into subtasks for component initialization, endpoint management, application lifecycle, status reporting, error handling, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating all previously developed components into a cohesive application. The complexity is high as it requires managing dependencies between components, handling configuration changes, and ensuring proper lifecycle management. Six subtasks would help manage this complexity by separating initialization, endpoint management, lifecycle, status reporting, error handling, and testing concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the CLI interface implementation into subtasks for argument parsing, command handling, output formatting, and integration with the main application.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a user-friendly command-line interface with multiple commands and options. The complexity is moderate as it involves argument parsing, command handling, and integration with the main application. Four subtasks would effectively separate argument parsing, command handling, output formatting, and integration concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Deployment Options",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the deployment options implementation into subtasks for GitHub Actions workflow, Docker configuration, AWS Lambda setup, documentation, and testing across platforms.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating deployment configurations for multiple platforms with different requirements. The complexity is high as it requires understanding platform-specific details and ensuring the application works correctly in each environment. Five subtasks would naturally align with the three deployment options, documentation, and cross-platform testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Basic Dashboard (Phase 2)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the dashboard implementation into subtasks for basic UI layout, endpoint status display, endpoint management controls, auto-refresh functionality, and integration with the main application.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a web-based dashboard using Streamlit with multiple interactive components. The complexity is moderate-high as it involves designing a user interface, implementing data visualization, and integrating with the main application. Five subtasks would effectively separate UI layout, status display, management controls, auto-refresh, and integration concerns."
